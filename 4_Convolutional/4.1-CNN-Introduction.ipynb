    "# Convolutional neural networks 101\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution neural networks are one of the most successful types of neural networks for image recognition and an integral part of reigniting the interest in neural networks. They are able to extract structural relations in the data, such as spatial in images or temporal in time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will experiment with inserting 2D-convolution layers in the fully connected neural networks introduced previously. We will also try to visualize the learned convolution filters and try to understand what kind of features they learn to recognize.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not watched Jason Yosinski's [video on visualizing convolutional networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgkfIQ4IGaM), you definitely should do so now. If you are unfamiliar with the convolution operation, [Vincent Dumoulin](https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic) has a nice visualization of different convolution variants. For a more in-depth tutorial, please see http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/ or http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap6.html."

    "## Reminder: what are convolutional networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard ConvNets are, in many respects, very similar to the dense feedforward networks we saw previously:\n",
    " * The network is still organized into layers.\n",
    " * Each layer is parameterized by weights and biases.\n",
    " * Each layer has an element-wise non-linear transformation (activation function).\n",
    " * There are no cycles in the connections (more on this in later labs).\n",
    "\n",
    "*So what is the difference?*\n",
    "The networks we saw previously are called *dense* because each unit receives input from all the units in the previous layer. This is not the case for ConvNets. In ConvNets each unit is only connected to a small subset of the input units. This is called the *receptive field* of the unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "The input (green matrix) is a tensor of size `1x5x5` -- i.e. it has one \"channel\" (like a grayscale image), and the feature map has size `5x5`. Let us define a `1x3x3` kernel (yellow submatrix). The kernel weights are indicated in red at the bottom right of each element. The computation can be thought of as an elementwise multiplication followed by a sum. Here we use a *stride* of 1, as shown in this animation:\n",

    "\n",
    "GIF courtesy of [Stanford](http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Feature_extraction_using_convolution)\n",
    "\n",
    "After having convolved the image, we perform an elementwise non-linear transformation on the *convolved features*.\n",
    "In this example, the input is a 2D *feature map* with depth 1.\n"

    "1. Note the performance of the standard feedforward neural network. Add a [2D convolution layer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html) before the first layer. Insert the utility module `PrintSize` to check the size of the tensor at any point in `Sequential`, and notice that the size of the image reduces after the convolution. This can cause loss of information, and can be avoided by using adequate padding in the convolutional layer.\n",
    "  Does adding a convolutional layer increase the generalization performance of the network (try num_filters=32 and filter_size=5 as a starting point)?\n",

    "3. We now have a deeper network than the initial simple feedforward network. What happens if we replace all convolutional layers with linear layers? Is this deep feedforward network performing as well as the convolutional one?\n",

    "4. Max-pooling is a technique for decreasing the spatial resolution of an image while retaining the important features. Effectively this gives a local translational invariance and reduces the computation by a factor of four. In the classification algorithm which is usually desirable. You can either: \n",
    " \n",
    "   - add a maxpool layer (see the PyTorch docs, and try with kernel_size=2 and stride=2) after the convolution layer, or\n",
    "   - add stride=2 to the arguments of the convolution layer directly.\n",
    "     \n",
    "  Verify that this decreases the spatial dimension of the image (insert a `PrintSize` module in the `Sequential`). Does this increase the performance of the network? Note that, to increase performance, you may need to stack multiple layers, increase the number of filters, or tune the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Dropout is a very useful technique for preventing overfitting. Try to add a DropoutLayer after some of the convolution layers. You may observe a higher validation accuracy but lower train accuracy. Can you explain why this might be the case?\n",

    "6. Batch normalization may help convergence in larger networks as well as generalization performance. Try to insert batch normalization layers into the network.\n"
