    "In this lab, we will introduce different ways of learning from sequential data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a recurring example, we will train neural networks to do language modelling, i.e. predict the next token in a sentence. In the context of natural language processing a token could be a character or a word, but mind you that the concepts introduced here apply to all kinds of sequential data, such as e.g. protein sequences, weather measurements, audio signals, or videos, just to name a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "To really get a grasp of what is going on inside a recurrent neural network (RNN), we will carry out a substantial part of this exercise in NumPy rather than PyTorch. We start off with a simple toy problem, build an RNN using NumPy, train and it, and see for ourselves that it really works. Once we're convinced, we proceed to build and train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell, also in NumPy. This is *not* simply to cause you frustration, but rather to provide you with a deeper understanding of the recurrence in RNNs, which will become very beneficial to you in the following weeks. Once you understand the inner workings of an RNN, we will proceed to a PyTorch implementation that you may use for the remainder of the course and in your projects.\n",

    "\n",
    "In previous labs we mainly considered data $x \\in \\mathrm{R}^d$, where $d$ is the feature space dimension.\n",
    "With time sequences our data can be represented as $x \\in \\mathrm{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d}$, where $t$ is the sequence length. \n",
    "This emphasises sequence dependence and that the samples along the sequence are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\n",
    "We will model functions as $\\mathrm{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{R}^c$, where $c$ is the amount of classes in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to represent sequences. With text, the challenge is how to represent a word as a feature vector in $d$ dimensions, as we are required to represent text with decimal numbers in order to apply neural networks to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will use a simple one-hot encoding but for categorical variables that can take on many values (e.g. words in the English language) this may be infeasible. For such scenarios, you can project the encodings into a smaller space by use of embeddings. If you want to learn more about tokens, encodings and embeddings than what is covered in this exercise, we highly recommend [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEMJRjEdNzM&list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z)."

    "Now that we can do forward passes and compute gradients with backpropagation, we're ready to train our network. For that we will need an optimizer. A common and easy to implement optimization method is stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which has the update rule: $\\theta_{n+1} = \\theta_{n} - \\eta \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\theta_{n}}$, where $\\eta$ is the learning rate and $E$ is our cost function. This is essentially what's going on behind the scenes when you run `optimizer.step()` in PyTorch using the SGD optimizer. If you want to learn more about optimization in a deep learning context, [this is a great starting point](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04747)."

Like in many things deep learning, we can build powerful models by stacking layers on top of each other; *bi-directional* RNNs consist of two LSTM cells, one for each direction. A sequence is first fed into the forward LSTM cell and the reversed sequence is then used as input to the backward LSTM cell together with the last hidden state from the forward LSTM cell. Follow [this link](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4b80/89bc9b49f84de43acc2eb8900035f7d492b2.pdf) for the original paper from 1997(!).\n",

For more information on this, check out the [LSTM PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#lstm). Next week we will also explore ways to combine RNNs with other types of layers for even more expressive function approximators."
