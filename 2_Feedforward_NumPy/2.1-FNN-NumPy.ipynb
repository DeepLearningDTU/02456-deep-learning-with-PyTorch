We are going to save these numbers in a list \"L\" that is going to start with our input dimensionality (the number of features in X) and is going to finish with our output dimensionality (the size of Y). Anything in between these values are going to be hidden layers and the number of hidden units in each hidden layer is defined by the researcher. Remember that for each unit in each layer (besides the first one, according to our list L) there is a bias term.\n",
    "2. **Activation functions** for each hidden layer. Each hidden layer in your list must have an activation function (it can also be the linear activation which is equivalent to identity function). The power of neural networks comes from non-linear activation functions that learn representations (features) from the data allowing us to learn from it. \n",
    "3. **Parameter initialization**. We will initialize the weights to have random values. This is done in practice by drawing pseudo random numbers from a Gaussian or uniform distribution. It turns out that for deeper models we have to be careful about how we scale the random numbers. This will be the topic of the exercise below. For now we will just use unit variance Gaussians.  \n",

For each layer in our neural network, initialize a matrix of weights of size (1, units_out) as above and save them in a list called \"bias\". The function should return a tuple (layers, bias).

    "[Einsum](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html) gives us the possibility to compute almost any matrix operation in a single function. You can find a good description in the link above. Here are a few examples of some important uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transpose:** We can write the transpose of matrix $A$:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "np.einsum('ij -> ji', A) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trace:** We can write the trace of matrix $A$:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "np.einsum('ii -> ', A) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diagonal:** We can write the diagonal of matrix $A$:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "np.einsum('ii -> i', A) \n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "**Matrix product:** We can write the multiplication of matrices $A$ and $B$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "np.einsum('ij, jk -> ik', A, B)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $j$ in both matrices $A$ and $B$ should be the same size. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Batched matrix product (or why bothering):** All of the functions we performed above are built in numpy (np.tranpose, np.trace, np.matmul), however, when you want to do more complex operations, it might become less readable and computationaly efficient. Let's introduce a three dimensional matrix $H$ with indices $b,j,k$, where the first dimension is the batch (training example) dimension. In einsum, we can then write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "np.einsum('ij, bjk -> bik', A, H)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform a batched matrix multiplication where we multiple over the second dimension in the first marix and second dimension in the second matrix. The result is a new three dimensional matrix where the first dimension is the first dimension from $H$ and second is the first dimension from $A$ and last dimension the last dimension from $H$. This is a very simple one line (and readable) way to do matrix operations that will be very useful for neural network code. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _**Tips and tricks when using einsum**_\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning, einsum might be a bit difficult to work with. The most important thing to do when using it is keeping track of the dimensions of your input and output matrices. An easy way to keep track of these dimensions is by using some sort of naming convention. Just like in the batched matrix product above we used $b$ to denote the batch dimension. In all the functions of this notebook, we leave some convention of names of indexes for the einsum in the explanation of the functions. We hope you find them useful!\n",
