    "# Purpose and goals\n",
    "In this notebook you will implement a simple neural network in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The building blocks of PyTorch are Tensors, and Operations, with these we can form dynamic computational graphs that represent neural networks.\n",
    "In this exercise we'll start right away by defining a logistic regression model using these simple building blocks.\n",
    "We'll initially start with a simple 2D and binary (i.e. two-class) classification problem where the class decision boundary can be visualized.\n",
    "Initially we show that logistic regression can only separate classes linearly.\n",
    "Adding a nonlinear hidden layer to the algorithm permits nonlinear class separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you should:\n",
    "* **First** run the code as is, and see what it does.\n",
    "* **Then** modify the code, following the instructions in the bottom of the notebook.\n",
    "* **Lastly** play around a bit, and do some small experiments that you come up with.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We assume that you are already familiar with backpropagation (if not please see [Andrej Karpathy](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/) or [Michal Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html))."

If the model is too complex it will often generalize poorly to new data (validation and test set). Can you observe this from the training and validation errors? \n",
