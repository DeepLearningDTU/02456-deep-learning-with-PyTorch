    "# MNIST dataset\n",
    "MNIST is a dataset that is often used for benchmarking. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits from 0-9. The dataset is split into a 50,000 images training set, 10,000 images validation set and 10,000 images test set. The images are 28x28 pixels, where each pixel represents a normalised value between 0-255 (0=black and 255=white).\n",

    "## Primer\n",
    "We use a feedforward neural network to classify the 28x28 mnist images. `num_features` is therefore $28 * 28=784$, i.e. we represent each image as a vector. The ordering of the pixels in the vector does not matter, so we could permutate all images using the same permutation and still get the same performance. (You are of course encouraged to try this using ``numpy.random.permutation`` to get a random permutation. This task is therefore called the _permutation invariant_ MNIST. Obviously this throws away a lot of structure in the data. In the next module we'll fix this with the convolutional neural network wich encodes prior knowledgde about data that has either spatial or temporal structure.  "
